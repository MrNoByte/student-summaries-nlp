# CommonLit - Evaluate Student Summaries
[**Kaggle Competition**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/commonlit-evaluate-student-summaries)


The goal of this competition is to assess the quality of summaries written by students in grades 3-12. You'll build a model that evaluates how well a student represents the main idea and details of a source text, as well as the clarity, precision, and fluency of the language used in the summary. You'll have access to a collection of real student summaries to train your model.
